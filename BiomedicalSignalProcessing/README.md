# Biomedical Signal processing project: ECG signal decomposition using Fourier analysis
### This is a project for the [Biomedical Signal processing](https://www.unimi.it/it/corsi/insegnamenti-dei-corsi-di-laurea/2025/biomedical-signal-processing) course of master's degree in Computer Science at the Universit√† degli Studi di Milano
**Code**: the simulations and practical examples are in [**this**](https://github.com/moroa01/Projects/blob/main/BiomedicalSignalProcessing/Simulations.m) file <br>
**Presentation**: the presentation (PowerPoint) on the project is in [**this**](https://github.com/moroa01/Projects/blob/main/BiomedicalSignalProcessing/Presentation.pptx) file 

### The signals used for testing the algorithm are:
#### - A standard ECG provided by the professor in the course
#### - An ECG of a patient with Ventricular hypertrophy from the PTB-XL dataset [here](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.1/)
#### - An ECG of a patient with Atrial fibrillation from the MIT-BIH dataset [here](https://physionet.org/content/afdb/1.0.0/)
#### - Some step signals to test some properties
